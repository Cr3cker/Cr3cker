### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ This is my little world where I create my shitty code. Enjoy your stay!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the backend FastAPI project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to refactor code (but so far it's not working out very well)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on OpenSource projects 
- âš¡ Fun fact: my code was not only useless, but also toxic. It held back our team for a whole quarter
