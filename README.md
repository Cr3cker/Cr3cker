### Hi everyone ğŸ‘‹ This is my little world where I post my shitty junior code. Make yourself at home!

<!--
**Cr3cker/Cr3cker** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the backend FastAPI project
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to refactor code (but so far it's not working out very well)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on OpenSource projects 
- âš¡ Fun fact: my code is not only useless, but also toxic. It holds back our team for a whole quarter
